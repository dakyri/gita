/**
 * <i>Client</i> is a package of useful client side applets that is an adjunct to the server side
 * visual language processing done by the gita package. 
 *<p>
 * The main (i.e. only) bit of useful stuff in this package is really the applet Scrounger, which is designed
 * to take stroke data captured from the anoto device, and transmit it to the gita server. This is a
 * bit of a hack to make things a bit more convenient, and make any demonstrations of gita have the
 * semblance of smooth integration. All a bit annoying, because:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The full anoto device is designed to talk directly to a web server. This, however, requires the
 *     full anoto developer kit, not some <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=chickenshit">
 *     <i>chickenshit</i></a> demo version. Unfortunately, they will hit you about $10K for the privilege.
 * <li>The full anoto device does a lot of painful authorisation and handshaking that is pointlessly anal
 *     and obstructive to the good use of the device. Why didn't they make it talk locally like any
 *     self-respecting pointer/input device?
 * </ul>
 *<p>
 * Ideally, gita's preferred input is SVG files: standard, w3c reccomended, and extensible for
 * gita's own processing results. Gita does processing on Anoto logs to create equivalent svg which can
 * then be used by the system. Other applets could be used to provide this translation and transport for
 * other protocols/digital ink sources.
 *<p>
 * In a bigger picture, and fuller implementation, it may be useful to have a few applets running, and use
 * them to actually execute application programs on the client side of the system ... or to act as
 * some kind of client side intermediaries.
